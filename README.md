# Hola! So glad to see you here 🐮

I'm a freelance web designer who is currently studying automation testing and frontend technologies. My interest is working with JAMStack and web automation. My background is in customer support, where I helped clients troubleshoot technical cases and billing issues within the SaaS industries. For fun, I develop visual novel games using Ren'Py and teach a webcomics design course on Skillshare. I started writing my tech articles on Hashnode back in February 2020 as I enjoy writing and sharing my thoughts with the tech community. 

## Fun facts about me 🌙

👩🏻‍💻I play *The Sims 4* using mods and custom content. I sometimes create my own outfits for my characters.

🎨 I teach a course on webcomics design via Skillshare. You can enroll in my course [here](https://skl.sh/3fxrr02).

📚 I love to read romance and cozy mysteries books. 

🎵 I listen to heavy metal music while I work and play.

☕ I drink Teecchino herbal tea as I'm sensitive to caffeine.
