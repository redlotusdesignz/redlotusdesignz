# Hola! So glad to see you here üêÆ

I'm a web designer who is currently studying automation testing and front-end technologies. I write my articles on Hashnode related to web design and game development. My background is in customer support, where I help clients troubleshoot technical cases and provide creative solutions within the SaaS & E-Commerce industries. For fun, I develop visual novel games using Ren'Py and create webcomics as part of my ongoing series "Lotus Cow Comics", which are available on WEBTOON Canvas and Tapas.
