# Hola! So glad to see you here.

I'm a senior support engineer who is currently learning software testing principals and APIs. Previously, I freelanced as a web designer where I helped small businesses create websites under Squarespace and Shopify platforms. 

When I'm not working, you'll find me creating Sims 4 content at my [main website](http://redlotusdesignz.com).
