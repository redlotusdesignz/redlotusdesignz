# Hola! So glad to see you here 🐮

I'm a freelance web designer who is currently studying software testing. My background is in customer support, where I helped clients troubleshoot technical cases and billing issues within SaaS companies. For fun, I develop visual novel games using Ren'Py. I started writing my tech articles back in February 2020 as I enjoy writing and sharing my thoughts with the tech community. 

## Fun facts about me 🌙

👩🏻‍💻I play *The Sims 4* using mods and custom content. I sometimes create my own outfits for my characters.

📚 I love to read romance and cozy mysteries books. 

🎵 I listen to heavy metal music while I work and play.

☕ I drink Teecchino herbal tea since caffeine is not my friend.
