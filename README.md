# Hola! So glad to see you here 🐮

I'm a customer support veteran who decided to embark on my frontend web development journey. I was laid off from my job back in early 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic started. I started writing my tech articles back in February 2020 on [DEV.to](http://dev.to/redlotusdesignz) & [Hashnode](http://redlotusdesignz.hashnode.dev) as a way of logging my progress, while providing my tips to other aspiring developers. My current interest is working with JAMstack and providing ways on making websites more accessible for visitors.
