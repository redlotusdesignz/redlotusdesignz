# Hola! So glad to see you here 🐮

I'm a web designer who is currently studying automation testing and front-end technologies. I write my articles on Hashnode related to web design and visual novel game development. My background is in customer support, where I help clients troubleshoot technical cases and provide creative solutions within the SaaS & E-Commerce industries. For fun, I create webcomics as part of my ongoing series "Lotus Cow Comics", which are available to read via [WEBTOON Canvas](https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/lotus-cow-comics/list?title_no=364889&page=1) and [Tapas](https://tapas.io/series/lotuscowcomics).

### Five facts about me: 

👩🏻‍💻I play The Sims 4 using mods and custom content. I sometimes create my own outfits for my characters.

🎨 I teach a course on webcomics design via Skillshare! You can enroll in my course [here](https://skl.sh/3fxrr02). 

📚 I love to read romance and cozy mysteries books.

🎵 I listen to heavy metal music while I work and play.

☕ I drink Teecchino herbal tea as I'm sensitive to caffeine.
