# Hola! So glad to see you here 🐮

I'm a web designer who is currently studying automation testing and front-end technologies. My interests are working with JAMStack and web automation. I love writing technical articles on Hashnode related to web design, game development, and my software testing journey.  My background is in customer support, where I help clients troubleshoot technical cases and provide creative solutions within the SaaS & E-Commerce industries. For fun, I develop visual novel games using Ren'Py. 

## Five facts about me 

👩🏻‍💻I play *The Sims 4* using mods and custom content. I sometimes create my own outfits for my characters.

🎨 I teach a course on webcomics design via [Skillshare](https://skl.sh/3fxrr02)! You can read my webcomic series “Lotus Cow Comics” on [WEBTOON Canvas](https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/lotus-cow-comics/list?title_no=364889&page=1) & [Tapas.io](https://tapas.io/series/lotuscowcomics). 

📚 I love to read romance and cozy mysteries books. 

🎵 I listen to heavy metal music while I work and play.

☕ I drink Teecchino herbal tea since I'm sensitive to caffeine.
